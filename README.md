....it has been too long, 42 days if my memory serves me. But I will never forget, the conflating turmoil, the desolation.

The day was dark, darker than the last. And he walked. Forward, unto the evening where the stars shown coyly.

He wasn't aware though, how could he have been. The muse... the grey scale eyes and eternal respite.

If only the sprite was available and brite. 

This is the app upon which to write, the days and raze of lives long past. But when you travel deep in mind, 
just remember to embrace the memory of that one time. 


The battle rages on.
